This is an attempt to provide a way to open a page in PapersÂ© via a toolbar button.

The Mekentosj foundation kindly authorized the use of the icons under a BSD Licence.

Release version 1.1 notice :

	- Keyboard shortcut is now supported. Hit ctrl+p to open the page in Papers.
	  The shortcut only work on newly opened tabs from the moment you update the extension. It won't work on already opened tabs.

Release version 1.2 notice :

	- Thanks to ymazuz, you can now right click a page to open it in papers. If the right-clicked item is a link, the link will open
	  in Papers instead of the current page. If text is selected when you open the page via the keybinding or the contextual menu, it will
	  be used as a default title in Papers.
